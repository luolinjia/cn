> The rain outside falling.  

My shoes with some small holes hate the rain, it will contain few rain water, even it will take up some soil. I remember that my shoes are so clean due to the road as clean as the blue sky in Shanghai at this very moment.   

The rain everywhere has the different style, heavy with the cold wind supplyed near the sea is Shanghai, but in Chongqing it happens suddenly and defenseless. It has a nice and cool climate this year, now is in mid July, I am so quiet although it is unusual. Lying down gently, happy to smell the clay, giving off a pleasant feeling.   

The best partner is music in a rainning day, soothing to enjoy it, closing my eyes slowly, the time seems to be static.
